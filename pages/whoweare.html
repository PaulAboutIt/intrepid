        <p class="para1">
          Over the past five years, Mark played a lead role in California’s implementation of federal HITECH Act programs to advance the Meaningful Use of electronic health records and health information exchange. In 2013, he directed CalHIPSO’s Regional Extension Center program as Chief Strategy Officer, managing ten local affiliates and over fifty consulting organizations assisting 6,000+ providers in qualifying for Meaningful Use. He joined CalHIPSO from UC Davis Health System and Cal eConnect, where he developed programs with a budget of over $6 million supporting health information exchange initiatives across the state. In these and prior roles at RAND and Lumetra, Mark managed teams focused on health care integration through information technology, quality improvement, and strategic partnerships. Raised in rural California, he is dedicated to supporting providers’ delivery of high-quality care to all. Mark received a BA from Stanford University and a PhD from the University of Chicago.

          <strong>Personal intrepid ascents: </strong>Mark’s bike commute home is a serious climb, and most weekends he runs the trails in Wildcat Canyon and the Berkeley hills. But the truly intrepid member of the family is his six-year-old son, who scales everything from Indian Rock to the 35-ft. rope swing in the backyard.
